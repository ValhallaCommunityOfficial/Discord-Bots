This is still in early access.

You will need to know how to run python and create a discord bot.

Edit these lines near the top of the code for your configuration.
```
TOKEN = ""  # Replace with your bot token
API_BASE_URL = ""  # Replace with your server's API URL
API_PASSWORD = ""  # Replace with your API password
AUTHORIZED_ROLE_ID = 1143359866260963467  # Replace with your authorized role ID
```

**These Bot permissions are required**
- Privileged Gateway Intents
  - Presence Intent
  - Message Content Intent
- Bot Perms
  - View Channels
  - Send Messages
  - Embed Links
  - Use Application Commands

**Full list of commands**
```/showmtstats```
```/removemtstats```
```/mtkick```
```/mtban```
```/mtmsg```
```/mtunban```
```/mtshowbanned```
```/mtmsg```
**Sending server messages with /mtmsg does not work until someone can direct me the correct POST.**

Server stats window is updated every 30 seconds.

I will continue to improve the code and post updates in this thread.
